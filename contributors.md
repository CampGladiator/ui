# Development Notes & Research

### MVP
- Migrate current styles to sass and move them to the new repository
- Ensure that the current API is BEM-compliant 
- Use Storybook to develop components
- Distribute through an NPM module and a CDN link
- Use Docz to create a user-friendly style guide website with usage examples and reasoning

### Next steps
- Create the React components package
- Implement full design system including missing elements (borders, shadows, breakpoints, grids, etc)
- Admin ui
